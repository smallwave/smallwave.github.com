> Chinese New Year is the most important festivity for the Chinese people.It is also called the Spring Festival.To the Chinese people,Spring Festival is as important as Christmas to people in the West.According to the Chinese tradition, preparation for the festival starts from the beginning of the last lunar month and festival celebrations extend until the 15th of the first lunar month.Nowadays few Chinese people can afford spending a whole month on festival activities due to the fast-paced life. However, most of the working people can enjoy a week-long public holiday, during which the most important are the New Year’s Eve and the first three days of the first lunar month.    

> Especially On Chinese New Year’s Eve, all family members enjoy a big, delicious meal. It is very important for the Chinese to be with their families on this occasion. Fish is always part of the dinner, because it represents abundance.
