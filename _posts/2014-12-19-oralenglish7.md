**what can you get from the communication?**

 Communication is the activity of conveying information through the exchange of thought, messages, or information. 

- On the one hand, communication spreads information, making us know the news although it’s far from us. By communicating with others, people send and get information that helps us know about our surroundings. We all know that information is extremely important in our lives. 

- On the other hand, communication builds personal relationship, which connects different people together. We live in the same society which makes personal relationship essential in lives. Only with communication can we build and keep good personal relationships with others.

- In addition, communication can eliminate misunderstandings and promote emotions. When we have misunderstandings with others, timely communicating is the only effective way to solve it.
