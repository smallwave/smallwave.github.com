> Hello everyone!


>  Nowadays, global warming is becoming a serious problem all over the world. Are Warnings about Global Warming Unduly Alarmist? Global warming is when the earth heats up (the temperature rises). It happens when greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrous oxide, and methane) trap heat and light from the sun in the earth’s atmosphere, which increases the temperature. This hurts many people, animals, and plants. Many cannot take the change, so they die.

> The consequences of global warming can make the global to redistribution of rainfall, melting of glacier and frozen earth, rising sea levels, which affects the balance of eco-system, more dangerous to human food supply and living environment.

- 1.The climate became warmer, ice melted and the sea level will rise, coastal erosion of the appalling consequences of global warming, seawater intrusion coastal ground fresh water layer, coastal land Stalinization, causing the coast, estuary, the gulf natural ecological environment imbalances, to the coastal ecological environment system disaster.

- 2.The waters area increased. Moisture to evaporate too much, extend the rainy season, the flood is becoming more and more frequent. Suffer from flooded opportunity to increase, suffered from storms and severity degree increase, reservoir dam shorten life. Rising sea levels will lead to some of the more coastal island submerged. There is a report tells that the sea was rising because of Global warming and 43 island countries worry was flooded.

- 3.Water's temperature increases could lead to the Antarctic Peninsula and the arctic sea's ice melt. The polar bear and walrus will become extinct. Global warming is will affect biological diversity. Many biological due to high temperatures and can not stand gradually become and slowly face genocide.
Global warming is affecting many parts of the world. Global warming makes the sea rise, and when the sea rises, the water covers many low land islands. This is a big problem for many of the plants, animals, and people on islands. The water covers the plants and causes some of them to die. When they die, the animals lose a source of food, along with their habitat. Although animals have a better ability to adapt to what happens than plants do, they may die also. 

> YES

- 1.First of all, global warming will make atmospheric water embellish up, and takes much more rain to inland. In northern Africa, central Asia, and China's the Midwest will become wet. China's northwest regions of the climate will dry and wet by sex into sex. Africa's Sahara desert will be narrowed, China of the gobi desert would gradually put on the green. These places will become more livable. Global warming made into a desert oasis.

- 2.climate change makes to produce more the high yield crop. With the slowly of development of the warm, the ground temperature rise, winter crops regional common move north, crop growing well, production was then had to add. Nearly 10 years, global production of crops and for once, climate change, natural disaster reduction, rain drenched is decisive. The production of United States, India and China Yield greatly improve and to ensure that the global hunger number down dramatically. Crop harvest, the high grass, making all kinds of animal husbandry in number have add, like Australia, New Zealand and other countries with developed up animal husbandry.

- 3.the global warming will make human beings reduce energy use, so reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Last year's warm winter led to the American people of heating oil have sharply reduce, its directly result is the international price drop. China's warm winter also make heating department save a lot of energy.
