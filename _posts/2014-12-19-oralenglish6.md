**what benefits can traveling give?**

 I love to travel. I even consider traveling as part of my routine life. So, I want to choose what benefits can 
traveling give us? 


- First, Traveling provides most opportunities for fun, adventure and discovery. When we visit places in other countries, we gain a better understanding of the local people. We learn their cultures, history and background. We discover the similarities they have with us, as well as their differences from us. 


- Second, Traveling helps to enrich our lives. It increases our knowledge and widen our perspective. When we visit interesting places, we discover and learn many things. Just like new people, new plants and new animals. 


- Third, Traveling is refreshing. It is a psychological necessity, especially for people who has stressful jobs. In this society, many people suffer most stress at work. The trip helps to relax stress. After the break, they feel more energize to return to work. 


- Fourth, Traveling provide opportunities for us to share our happiness with our friends and family. When we travel with our friends and family, we create common memories.


In a word, you can learn from your traveling experience more than you can imagine.
