> Hello everyone!


> Cooking is something that many people do. Some do it as a profession, some do it for fun, and some do it because they have to. Most people cook because eating anything raw is unappetizing and boring. I cook because it is entertaining and almost hypnotizing in a sense that I become almost oblivious to my surroundings. Sadly, some times I share the feeling of most people, gwhy o why do I have bother to do this. h But even if preparing a dish for themselves, people tend to get caught up and forget about anything else that is going on. When other people are the ones who will be enjoying the dish, the cook tends to have a feeling of wanting to make them astounded or awed at his or her culinary skills by preparing a better dining experience. It is a constant struggle for perfection and creativity.


> In the professional environment of cooking, the atmosphere is exigent. It is a fast moving and demanding environment. When working in such a place, one is soon to forget the time that is passing. As the product of the chef is taking shape, it looks more and more like a piece of art, with an amazing array of colour topped with astonishing garnishes. Chefs are people endlessly exploring the continual horizon of creativity in which the food can spread in any direction of space atop a plate. Another great part of cooking is the faces, comments, and reactions of the diners. Their faces are filled with the expression that speaks the flavour of the food and the opinion of the people themselves. A picture is worth a thousand words. I always remember that phrase when the food is served in front of the diner. And after that they speak. Their words persuade and encourage you for a higher level of achievement. Well at least most of the time. These are the reasons why culinary arts is an amazing field for anyone.
